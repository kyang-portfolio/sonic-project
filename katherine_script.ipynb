    "**Receiver Identification**:\n",
    "1. **Single Participant**:\n",

    "3. **Multiple Participants in Sequence**:\n",
    "  - Identify if the message addresses several participants one after the other.\n",

    "  - Whenever a message addresses several participants, indicate where the message should be split.\n",
    "  - Example: if the message is \"Oh, yeah. Brilliant. Vero, do you have any other ideas?\" and it is labeled as \"959,0\", also indicate that the message should be     split into \"Oh, yeah. Brilliant.\" and \"Vero, do you have any other ideas?\"\n",

    "4. **Mixed Addressing**:\n",
