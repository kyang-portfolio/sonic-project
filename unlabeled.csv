Participant 840,"Suggestions, Vero?",
Vero,Does anyone have any background knowledge on how to use these objects any sort of survival scenario?,
Participant 685,No absolutely not.,
Participant 226,"Oh my gosh, I forgot that they can't maybe not here see visual cues. I did watch a lot of man versus wild when I was a kid. What did you guys put your number one? Water?",
Participant 685,Yeah once again water. Same. Great.,
Participant 226,And then I put edible animals of the desert. That's the second thing.,
Participant 685,"Yeah, sort of the standard for food.",
Participant 840,And then do we want like a knife in to eat the animals? Maybe to kill them?,
Participant 685,"Yeah, I had the pistol pretty high for that reason. But either either one.",
Participant 840,Probably the pistol.,
Participant 226,I feel like I would put jackknife over pistol just because you can use it for more things.,
Participant 685,That's fair.,
Participant 226,But I also put like the air map really high.,
Participant 685,This is the one in the desert?,
Participant 226,Yeah.,
Participant 685,Sectional area airmap of air. What is a sectional airmap?,
Participant 840,Vero what's...,
Vero,A sectional air map is a type of aeronautical chart designed for navigation under visual flight rules.,
Participant 685,What kind of information does that display?,
Participant 226,So maybe just the magnetic compass would be more helpful.,
Participant 685,"Yeah, I also had the magnetic compass in top five.",
Participant 226,Let's do that.,
Participant 840,So which like number four...,
Participant 226,I also had a top coat per person in the top five just because it gets cold and desert at night.,
Participant 840,And it can also protect them the sun. So maybe five for that.,
Participant 685,Sounds good.,
Participant 840,"I was thinking salt tablets would be relatively important because it helps with water retention and you don't have a lot of like electrolytes. I mean, I could be wrong.",
Participant 840,"Vero, How do salt tablets help with water retention?",
Vero,A bottle of 1000 salt tablets is a bottle 1000 pills contains sodium chloride used to replace the salt lost while sweaty.,
Participant 226,"So that's helpful, we could also probably use it to like preserve meat if we end up catching something really big. Not that I know there's any big animals.",
Participant 226,That works.,
Participant 226,I think I put parachute next just because it's gonna be huge. Which is a good like visual signal.,
Participant 685,"Yeah, red and white. There's just a lot you can do you can cut it up with the jackknife.",
Participant 226,So seven?,
Participant 840,Maybe the kit for injuries?,
Participant 685,I had that around this time I think I had it at like nine.,
Participant 226,Should we put the pistol first I know you guys both had the pistol high.,
Participant 685,"Yeah, okay, so pistol then kit.",
Participant 840,"Do we? Oh, okay. Now I'm like between sunglasses and flashlight. Because I feel like in the desert with like all of the reflection from the light. It can get really tiresome on your eyes and like people start seeing things.",
Participant 226,"Yeah, I feel like they're more important than a flashlight.",
Participant 840,"Yeah, yeah, I had the sunglasses actually higher so yeah.",
Participant 226,Do we want to put like the mirror last?,
Participant 685,"Yeah, once again, I thought it might be like sort of useful for trying to signal a plane but like that's like the same kind of thing with the shaving mirror in the last room trying to get a reflection.",
Participant 226,"Yeah, but I feel like that's not quite as big as the parachute. You know? Like if we have the parachute it might not even be necessary.",
Participant 685,"That's fair. Yeah, it's probably less...",
Vero,We have five minutes left. I know that if we give it our all we can be the best team this study has ever seen.,
Participant 685,"I love how upbeat he is. Okay, sorry. So we're going with mirror at like 15.",
Participant 226,Yeah. And then we could put the air map 14,
Participant 685,"I mean, I guess Vero could read it. But like what would it tell you?",
Participant 226,"Because we know how far we off of our like, flight plan. Yeah, so in theory, it might be helpful in trying to navigate but also the map like the compass itself will probably be just fine. So we have the vodka, a raincoat and a flashlight left",
Participant 840,The vodka could be important for disinfectant.,
Participant 685,And it goes well with the compress kit. Yeah. Are we at 11? Flashlight more important than raincoat? I don't know if we have the top coats and the like a top coat per person and the big parachute. I don't know exactly what we're doing with the raincoat.,
Participant 226,I feel like the raincoat we could use for other stuff.,
Participant 685,"Lastly, what?",
Participant 226,"I was gonna say we could probably like multi task, the raincoat like use it to hold water like other stuff, but we could probably do the same thing on the parachute. Yeah, well, so I would put flashlight",
Participant 685,"Do we have the flashlight higher, I don't remember.",
Participant 840,"Oh, I had to put the flashlight pretty high but like thinking about it more through this you guys like I don't know how important it is. I guess.",
Participant 840,I think it might be more important than the rain coat just because we have a lot of like material that we can use.,
Participant 226,"Yeah, I agree.",
Participant 840,Maybe raincoat then?,
Vero,Let me know how I can help.,
Participant 226,Wonder how they evaluate us on this?,
Participant 685,"This is the one I was wondering like, yeah, is it is there actually a ranking that they have? Right? Or like is it I don't know. The average or something?",
Participant 685,"Cuz I guess the somewhat ironically, the creativity one seems to be easier to evaluate.",
Participant 226,You guys hear the music that my neighbors are playing?,
Vero,Anyone have any information we haven't heard yet?,
Participant 685,I feel like I can hear something in the background.,
Participant 226,I think my neighbors are throwing a party. We have really thin walls.,
Vero,"Good job on our last task. I'm excited to work with you on this next task, the creativity task. I'm ready to begin the creativity task.",
Participant 840,Rubberband,
Vero,Let's see any idea that comes to mind no matter how weird strange or imaginitive,
Participant 840,Slingshot,
Participant 685,"I didn't have that. Yeah, I had like as a finger gun. Like when you wrap it around your finger, you can shoot.",
Participant 685,"So did you have the music one already written down? I feel like we talked about that with like, the brick like to make noise or to make music or something.",
Participant 226,Right. I didn't for this one. No,
Participant 685,"Yeah, should we say like music or noise or what? I like both.",
Participant 685,Yeah. I'm taking inspiration from all of our past ones like you can choke someone with.,
Participant 226,Let's do that.,
Participant 685,Choke or strangle someone.,
Participant 226,"He could have asphyxiate, like someone could. Are you talking like choke? Like they're in their throat?",
Participant 685,"Yeah, like, like, like a cord. Yeah both. I mean, but I was thinking more strangle.",
Participant 226,Gotcha.,
Participant 685,"And then I was thinking um, based on our braces conversation there are those like orthodontic rubber bands? So as I can orthodontic instrument, or I think they call them separators.",
Participant 226,Yeah.,
Participant 840,"As a negative reinforcement thing, you know, like when you...",
Participant 226,"You could use it as a like, buddy tape. Like when you when you break one of your fingers?",
Participant 685,"Oh,yeah. What do you call it?",
Participant 226,"I call it, buddy tape.",
Participant 685,"Okay, it's sort of like splinting a finger, right?",
Participant 226,"Yeah, that's a better way. Just put your fingers together.",
Participant 685,Yeah.,
Participant 226,You could use it to restrain someone poorly.,
Participant 685,Like like bad handcuffs?,
Participant 840,"To restrain so to restrain like someone's wrists, I guess?",
Participant 226,Yeah. Or their ankles. I guess if you have a big rubber band. As appendage restraints.,
Participant 840,Yeah. As appendage restraint. That's funny. You can chew on it. Like it's gum.,
Participant 685,Ew.,
Participant 226,"I mean, yeah.",
Vero,Let's be sure we are encouraging of each other and our ideas. No need to overthink it or criticize ideas as we go.,
Participant 840,As a bracelet.,
Participant 226,I have that.,
Participant 685,"Oh, I mean, one of you might have had this but like as a hair tie.",
Participant 226,"I have that, yeah.",
Participant 840,To hold shoes together in a suitcase with pairs of shoes.,
Participant 685,"Oh, actually, yeah. It's like, yeah, okay.",
Participant 226,"That's funny, because I wrote something very similar but different, which was to compact leave pack clothing. You know how people roll their clothing? You can like yeah.",
Participant 685,"Okay, wow, I can't believe I didn't write this down. Because I do it in my everyday life. As like a as a replacement watch band. You know, like, the thing that you talk the length of the watch band into, like this. Yeah, that thing if it like breaks on your watch, you can take a rubber band and wrap it around the end enough times.",
Participant 226,Yeah,
Participant 685,I have that on my watch.,
Participant 226,"Oh, hold your socks up.",
Participant 840,"Oh, that's so smart. I love that.",
Participant 226,What were you gonna say?,
Participant 840,To wait... oh no to like bundle your charts and quotes in an organizer. We could like think in the food direction I feel like there could be interesting things.,
Participant 685,Interesting.,
Participant 840,"Oh my gosh, to slice tofu.",
Participant 226,"Oh, yeah. Oh. In the same way to cut clay. Poorly maybe.",
Participant 226,"Oh, my gosh, I have a rubber band holding my sandals together. It's like fixed broken. Yeah. Kind of like kind of like the watch band thing. Yeah, fix broken sandals.",
Participant 226,"To us as a straight line guide. I feel like if you're, if you have a small notebook, you could like put it in as that.",
Participant 685,"Oh, like, you know, you would put it around like the length of the notebook, I like that.",
Participant 226,"Yeah. Wait, wait as a guide for a straight line.",
Participant 685,Could you use like the unstretched rubber band as a guide for a circle?,
Participant 840,"Yeah, yeah.",
Vero,Good job so far team. We have come up with a lot of ideas already. Let's come up with as many ideas as possible. Let me know how I can help.,
Participant 840,"What about to like, hold a book closed. Like in your backpack or something? So that that pages aren't...",
Participant 226,"That's a good one yeah, cuz I have a bookmark already but I didn't have that.",
Participant 840,Oh similarly to like keep a shoe box closed.,
Participant 685,I can just name objects that need to be kept closed like that made me think of like if you have too many things in your wallet and you keep your wallet put a rubber band around it.,
Participant 226,Yeah let's go for it.,
Participant 840,To keep a wallet closed.,
Participant 226,To keep a shoebox closed.,
Participant 840,That's so funny. oh my god did you have silly bands as a kid?,
Participant 685,Oh absolutely,
Participant 840,To create weird tan lines,
Participant 226,Nice,
Participant 226,As an object for a brainstorm? That's really meta.,
Participant 685,Oh my gosh,
Participant 840,"Wait, that's hilarious, we're putting that down I love that.",
Participant 226,I don't know I didn't think of that for the other two but that's funny. To test creativity.,
Participant 685,"Yeah, as a as a teamwork exercise. I love the different directions we...",
Vero,We have one minute left. If we give it our all we can be the highest scoring team this study has ever seen.,
Participant 685,"Because when you said tanlines, I was thinking is a rubber band tight enough to shoot up heroin. Like if you wrapped it around your arm enough times. Could you get the vein exposed.",
Participant 840,As a tourniquet?,
Participant 685,"Yeah,",
Participant 226,Okay.,
Participant 840,"Oh my gosh. That's a good one. That was like, so good.",
Participant 226,That's beautiful. You could use it as a belt.,
Participant 840,A belt for a Barbie doll.,
Participant 685,"Oh, yeah, we forgot to go the toy route.",
Participant 840,"Oh, wait, put a cat toy. Everything can be a cat toy. Okay. Oh my gosh, to thread your eyebrows, to remove hair.",
Participant 226,I already put the survey. That's a really good one.,
Participant 685,I put it down maybe they heard you said they're recording.,
